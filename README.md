# Trial-and-error
My different tests with Java
18/12/20 - Currently having some problems in running JUnit 5 tests (example-app). Tried moving the JUnit library under modulepath and classpath to see what changed. Under modulepath, it opens the console giving me a long list of errors. Under classpath, nothing happens, no diagnostic pops up.
